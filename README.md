# timetable-tsr

Private project on rebuilding the calendar app that I use daily (-> TimeTree ;  it's great) using Create-Vite and Typescript.

While it is still a (working) mess, I am on my way to clean up the code.

Try it @ https://timetable-react-app.vercel.app/

Done:
> Local Storage for events
> Double click for quick event
> Interactive search bar


Missing:
> Mobile-friendly grid
> Clean(er) code and stronger type safety
> Some settings
> Better visibility for multi-day events
